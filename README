Here is a sample Yara rule that could be used to detect the Heartbleed vulnerability on a Linux machine. This rule looks for the specific pattern of bytes that are sent in a Heartbleed attack, as well as a payload containing a large number of null or 0xff bytes, which is a sign of the vulnerability.

Please note that this is a basic rule and it may not be 100% effective in identifying all cases of the Heartbleed vulnerability, and also it's important to test the rule on a non-production system before using it in production.

You probably wont find it out in the wild, but this was fun for a throwback.
